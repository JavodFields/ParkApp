# ParkApp
The project is currently full of test files to make sure everyone can clone and create pull requests and such. Make sure you fork off of the main repo before you clone. This will help with when we bring the code back together to ensure that errors don't form due to two people code clashing. If you've never done a fork before you can just click fork in the top right corner and choose your name. Then when you go into Netbeans there is a clone option and you can clone your individual fork's link.

When committing your changes you can do the following in the terminal:
<br>~ make sure you're in the ParkApp directory
<br>~ git add .
<br>~ git commit -m "enter a message about your commit here"
<br>~ git push
<br><br>
From there you can go into your GitHub fork and you should see the pushed code. Create a pull request from your fork to the main organization's repo. After you make your request you should be able to go into the main organization's repo and view the pull request which will tell you if there will be any problems with merging your code. If not merge the code and you're good to go. Woo
